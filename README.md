# User scripts

1. Install a user script add-on, I personally use [FireMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firemonkey/).
1. Then browse to the raw url of a user script, like such: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOUSAND-SKY/ff-user-scripts/main/name-change.user.js>.
1. It should offer to install it and now it should just work on the url's configured in the script.
